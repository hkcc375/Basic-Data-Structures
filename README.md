# Basic Data Structures

This repository contains methods/operations that one would use while interacting with these data strucutures. Theese would be Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Hash Tables, Linked Lists. Also, for the purpose of simplicity, I am going to be using C language.










Note : This is not by any means an exhaustive list. This list will be constantly changing.
